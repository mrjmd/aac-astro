*Updated: March 7, 2026*
*Preview: https://aac-astro.vercel.app/*

## Pre-Launch Blockers

These must be done before DNS cutover. Nothing else launches the site.

### Photos (Matt)

- [ ] Provide real photos for service page heroes (6 minimum: injection, wall crack, bulkhead, carbon fiber, sewer/conduit, consultation)
- [ ] Provide About page story photo (`public/images/about-story.jpg`)
- [ ] Provide CT + MA hub hero images
- [ ] Replace remaining placeholder images as assets become available (~40 more across concrete repair, state hubs, blog, city pages)
- [ ] Remove picsum.photos whitelist from `check-images.js` once all placeholders replaced (makes placeholders a build error)
- [ ] Optimize all new images (proper sizing, WebP/AVIF)
- [ ] Verify all images have meaningful alt text

### Testimonial Verification (Matt)

- [ ] Verify 20 testimonial quotes match actual Google reviews — names, cities, text accurate
- [ ] Confirm legal/compliance: each quote from a real customer who gave permission

### Manual QA (Both)

- [ ] All navigation links work
- [ ] All footer links work
- [ ] Contact forms submit correctly
- [ ] Phone numbers correct: CT (860) 573-8760, MA (617) 668-1677
- [ ] Addresses correct: CT 23 Elsmere Road, Amston, CT 06231; MA 30 Randlett St #2, Quincy, MA 02169
- [ ] "260+ Google reviews" claim is current
- [ ] Images load on all pages
- [ ] Mobile responsive (iPhone, Android)
- [ ] Schema validates in Google Rich Results Test
- [ ] Favicon displays correctly

### Automated Validation (Claude)

- [ ] Full `npm run validate` pass (clean)
- [ ] `npm run check:images` passes with 0 placeholder warnings
- [ ] Lighthouse: Performance 90+, Accessibility 95+, SEO 95+
- [ ] All pricing claims verified correct
- [ ] Uniqueness validation passes

### 301 Redirects & Old Site Preservation (Claude + Matt)

**Current state:** Sitemap crawled, 31 redirects now in `vercel.json` (was 10). All old Squarespace URLs from the sitemap are mapped. Remaining items need Matt's account access.

- [x] **Crawl the live Squarespace site** — pulled full sitemap from `attackacrack.com/sitemap.xml` (36 URLs)
- [x] **Map every old URL to its new equivalent** — all 36 mapped, 21 new redirects added
- [x] **Add all missing 301 redirects to `vercel.json`** — 31 total redirects now (was 10)
- [x] **Handle blog post URLs** — all 12 old blog slugs redirected to new slugs
- [x] **Handle /store/ partner pages** — `/store` and `/store/p/:slug` → `/massachusetts/trusted-partners`
- [x] **Handle /home, /trusted-partners, /partners/general-contractors** — all redirected
- [ ] **Crawl Google Search Console** — export all indexed URLs (may include pages not in sitemap)
- [ ] **Export Google Analytics top pages** — identify every URL with real traffic
- [ ] **Handle any old `/blog/` tag/category pages** — redirect to new category structure if they exist
- [ ] **Handle old image URLs** — Squarespace CDN images linked from external sites
- [ ] **Test every redirect after DNS cutover** — verify all 31 redirects resolve correctly
- [ ] **Check for external backlinks** — Ahrefs/SEMrush backlink audit, ensure linked URLs redirect

### DNS Cutover (Matt)

- [ ] Backup current attackacrack.com
- [ ] Switch `public/robots.txt` from `Disallow: /` to `Allow: /`
- [ ] Remove `is-crawlable: 'off'` from `lighthouserc.cjs`
- [ ] Raise `categories:seo` threshold in `lighthouserc.cjs` from 0.69 → **0.95**
- [ ] Point attackacrack.com DNS to Vercel
- [ ] Verify SSL certificate
- [ ] Test all redirects work (`vercel.json`)
- [ ] Submit sitemap to Google Search Console
- [ ] Monitor for 404 errors

## Bug Fixes (Claude)

### Projects on Service Pages — FIXED

- [x] Fix `getByService()` in `src/utils/projects.ts` — was querying `p.data.serviceType` (singular), now uses `serviceTypes.includes()` (array)
- [x] Add concrete repair service types to `SERVICE_SLUG_MAP` (driveway, patio, walkway, pool-deck, stairway, garage-floor)
- [x] Verify projects appear on all 6 service pages + 6 concrete repair pages after fix

### Service Area Display — Only Showing CT & MA (Should Be All New England)

Service pages (`services/[slug].astro`) only show CT and MA in the "Available In" section at the bottom. RI, NH, and ME are missing. The concrete repair index page says "For foundation repair, we serve both MA and CT" — should say all of New England.

- [ ] **Audit all pages** for territory language limited to CT/MA — find every instance across service pages, concrete repair pages, hubs, components, content files
- [x] Fix service page `[slug].astro` "Available In" section to include all 5 states (CT, MA, RI, NH, ME)
- [x] Fix concrete repair index page to say "all of New England" instead of "MA and CT"
- [ ] Fix any other pages/components that limit territory to just 2 states
- [ ] Verify all 5 states appear wherever service territory is mentioned

### "No Salesperson" / "Person Who Does the Work" Language — Remove

Matt doesn't want "no salespeople" / "no salesperson" language anywhere on the site. Also doesn't want "speak directly to the person who does the job" — Matt talks to customers with expertise but doesn't do the repairs himself. "Talk to an expert" is the right framing.

- [ ] **Audit all pages and content** for "no sales", "salesperson", "salespeople" language
- [ ] **Audit for "person who does the job/work/repair"** and similar claims
- [ ] Replace with "talk to an expert" or equivalent language
- [ ] Verify no instances remain after fix

### Projects on Location Pages — Improve Proximity

- [ ] Current fallback: random same-state projects. Improve to nearest-town proximity using coordinates from `CITY_COORDS` in `project-import-core.js`
- [ ] Verify location pages show local projects first, then nearby towns, then same-state

---

## Page-Level Improvements

### Completed

### Remaining

- [ ] Create ServiceAreaMap.astro with New England outline + 80 city dots
- [ ] Color-code by establishment (CT/MA blue, RI/NH/ME lighter)
- [ ] Add to areas-we-serve page

#### Pre-Launch Visual QA Pass (Matt)

- [ ] Homepage walkthrough
- [ ] Services hub + each service page
- [ ] About page
- [ ] Updates page

## SEO Competitive Deep-Dive (Claude + Matt)

Full competitive audit to maximize SERP dominance before and after launch.

### Data Collection (Matt — needs account access)

- [ ] **Google Search Console export** — all queries, pages, impressions, clicks, positions for attackacrack.com
- [ ] **Google Analytics export** — top landing pages, organic traffic by page, bounce rates, conversion paths
- [ ] **SEMrush competitive analysis** — pull reports for:
  - [ ] attackacrack.com current keyword rankings (organic positions)
  - [ ] Top 5 competitors (identify who ranks for our target terms in CT, MA, RI, NH, ME)
  - [ ] Competitor keyword gaps — terms they rank for that we don't
  - [ ] Competitor backlink profiles — who's linking to them
  - [ ] Keyword difficulty + search volume for our target terms
  - [ ] SERP feature analysis — which terms trigger local packs, FAQs, featured snippets

### Competitive Analysis (Claude)

### Citation & Off-Page (Matt + Claude)

- [ ] **Citation audit** — verify NAP consistency across all directories (Yelp, BBB, Angi, HomeAdvisor, etc.)

## Blog Content & Auto-Publishing

### Content Status

- 73 total blog posts (32 published, 41 drafts ready for Q2-Q4)

### Matt Review (Blocking Publication)

- [ ] **Read all 41 draft blog posts** for accuracy and voice — every article needs a read-through
- [ ] Flag any that need revision
- [ ] Provide/source hero images — all 73 posts have `heroImage: ""`

### Auto-Publishing Setup — DONE

Shared `isPublished()` filter in `src/utils/blog.ts` checks both `!draft` and `publishDate <= now`. All 5 blog listing pages use it. Weekly Monday 6am ET cron redeploy via `.github/workflows/weekly-redeploy.yml`.

- [x] Add build-time filter: only publish posts where `draft !== true` AND `publishDate <= buildDate`
- [x] Add GitHub Action cron job (weekly, Monday 6am ET) to trigger Vercel redeploy
- [ ] Test: set a post with past `publishDate` + `draft: false`, verify it appears after build
- [ ] Test: set a post with future `publishDate` + `draft: false`, verify it does NOT appear
- [ ] Document workflow: Matt sets `draft: false` on reviewed posts; they auto-publish when `publishDate` arrives
