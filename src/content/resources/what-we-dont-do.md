## What We Don't Do

### Basement Waterproofing Systems

**What this includes:**
- Interior perimeter drainage systems (French drains)
- Sump pump installation
- Full basement waterproofing

**Why we don't do it:**
Basement waterproofing is a different specialty requiring different equipment, training, and warranties. While we repair cracks that leak water, comprehensive waterproofing is beyond our scope.

**Who to call:**
Look for dedicated basement waterproofing companies with experience in New England conditions. Check for transferable warranties and ask about their drainage system approach.

---

### Foundation Replacement

**What this includes:**
- Complete foundation demolition and re-pour
- Lifting house to build new foundation
- Converting crawlspace to full basement

**Why we don't do it:**
Foundation replacement is major construction requiring specialized equipment, engineering, and permits. It's typically a $100,000+ project that takes weeks.

**Who to call:**
Contact foundation contractors who specialize in replacement, or structural contractors experienced in house lifting. Get multiple quotes and verify their references for similar projects.

---

### Structural Engineering

**What this includes:**
- Foundation failure analysis
- Load calculations
- Structural design and specifications
- Signed engineering documents

**Why we don't do it:**
Structural engineering requires a Professional Engineer (PE) license and carries liability for design decisions. We're skilled contractors, not engineers.

**Who to call:**
Search for "residential structural engineer" in your area. Many foundation problems don't require engineering, but if you need permits or have complex issues, an engineer's report may be necessary.

---

### New Concrete Installation

**What this includes:**
- Pouring new driveways, patios, sidewalks
- New concrete foundations
- Concrete flatwork

**Why we don't do it:**
We resurface existing concrete—we don't pour new. New concrete work requires different equipment, crew specialization, and site preparation.

**Who to call:**
Contact concrete contractors who specialize in residential flatwork. For driveways and patios, look for contractors with experience in your specific project type.

---

### Excavation Work

**What this includes:**
- Exterior foundation waterproofing
- Foundation drainage installation
- Digging around foundation perimeter

**Why we don't do it:**
Excavation requires heavy equipment, utility location expertise, and carries risks for landscaping and existing structures. We work from interior spaces.

**Who to call:**
Excavation contractors or foundation waterproofing companies that offer exterior solutions. Ensure they carry proper insurance for this work.

---

### Structural Steel or Major Framing

**What this includes:**
- Support beam installation
- Load-bearing wall modifications
- Major structural framing repairs

**Why we don't do it:**
While we install carbon fiber reinforcement and work with foundation cracks, major structural framing is beyond our specialty.

**Who to call:**
General contractors with structural experience, or specialized structural repair contractors. Complex jobs may need an engineer's direction.

---

### Chimney Foundation Repair

**What this includes:**
- Chimney base rebuilding
- Chimney separation from house
- Chimney foundation stabilization

**Why we don't do it:**
Chimney work requires specialized masonry skills and often involves roofing and flashing considerations.

**Who to call:**
Masonry contractors who specialize in chimney repair. Look for CSIA-certified professionals for chimney-specific issues.

---

### Historic Preservation Restoration

**What this includes:**
- Museum-quality restoration work
- Historically accurate material matching
- Work requiring historic commission approval

**Why we don't do it:**
While we repair fieldstone and other historic foundations, true preservation restoration requires specialized expertise and documentation.

**Who to call:**
Preservation contractors familiar with your local historic commission requirements. The National Trust for Historic Preservation maintains contractor listings.
