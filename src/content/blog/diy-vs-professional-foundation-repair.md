Here's something most foundation repair companies won't tell you: **not every crack needs professional repair.** Some issues you can absolutely handle yourself, while others require expert intervention.

At Attack A Crack, we believe in honesty—even when it means talking ourselves out of a job. So here's our honest guide to what you can DIY and when to call us.

## When DIY Is Appropriate

### Hairline Cosmetic Cracks

**What they look like:**
- Thinner than a credit card (less than 1/16 inch)
- No water infiltration
- Stable (not growing)
- Vertical or nearly vertical

**DIY approach:**
These are often shrinkage cracks that don't affect structural integrity or let water in. You can:
1. Monitor them for growth (mark endpoints and measure monthly)
2. Apply elastomeric sealant for cosmetic improvement
3. Paint over them if they're in finished space

**Products that work:**
- Elastomeric concrete sealant
- Masonry crack filler
- Flexible polyurethane caulk

### Minor Efflorescence

**What it is:**
White, chalky mineral deposits on basement walls. This is salt left behind when water evaporates through the concrete.

**DIY approach:**
1. Scrub with a stiff brush and water
2. For stubborn deposits, use a diluted muriatic acid solution (with proper safety equipment)
3. Address the moisture source if possible

**When it becomes a professional issue:**
If you see significant efflorescence with active water seepage, you have a water infiltration problem that needs proper repair.

### Small Surface Spalling

**What it is:**
Small areas where the concrete surface is flaking or deteriorating.

**DIY approach:**
1. Remove loose material
2. Clean the area thoroughly
3. Apply concrete patching compound
4. Seal after curing

## When to Call a Professional

### Water Actively Entering

If water is coming through a crack—even occasionally—DIY surface treatments won't work. Here's why:

Surface sealers only address the visible crack. Water entering your foundation travels through the entire wall thickness (8-10 inches of concrete). Professional injection fills the complete crack path from inside to outside.

**DIY risk:** Surface sealing can trap water inside the wall, leading to freeze-thaw damage and larger cracks.

### Cracks Wider Than 1/4 Inch

Wide cracks indicate significant movement and often require more than surface treatment. They may need:
- Deep injection to fill the void
- Structural assessment
- Carbon fiber reinforcement

**DIY risk:** Wide cracks can continue to grow if the underlying cause isn't addressed.

### Horizontal Cracks

Horizontal cracks indicate lateral pressure against your foundation. This is serious structural territory that requires professional assessment.

**DIY risk:** Horizontal cracks indicate a wall that may be failing. DIY repair could give false confidence while the problem worsens.

### Stair-Step Cracking in Block Walls

This pattern in concrete block foundations indicates differential settlement or structural stress.

**DIY risk:** Without addressing the cause, any surface repair will fail quickly.

### Growing Cracks

If a crack is getting longer, wider, or both, something is actively happening. You need to:
1. Identify why the crack is growing
2. Address that root cause
3. Repair the damage

**DIY risk:** Growing cracks indicate ongoing movement. Sealing the surface won't stop the progression.

### Foundation at a Lean or Bow

If walls are visibly leaning, bowing, or out of plumb, you have a structural issue requiring professional stabilization.

**DIY risk:** A failing wall is a safety hazard. Don't attempt to address this yourself.

## The Honest Truth About DIY Crack Kits

Home improvement stores sell injection kits for foundation cracks. Here's our honest assessment:

**What's in the kit:**
- Injection ports (plastic tabs)
- Surface sealant (epoxy paste)
- Injection material (usually epoxy)
- Injection gun or caulk-tube system

**When they work:**
- Small, dormant, non-leaking cracks
- Hairline cracks for cosmetic improvement
- As a temporary measure while planning professional repair

**When they fail:**
- Actively leaking cracks (the crack must be dry for epoxy)
- Wider cracks that need more material than the kit provides
- Cracks with debris or previous failed repairs
- Any crack requiring structural repair

**Why professional injection is different:**

| DIY Kit | Professional Injection |
|---------|----------------------|
| Low-pressure application | High-pressure injection |
| Limited material volume | Unlimited material as needed |
| Rigid epoxy only | Flexible urethane or structural epoxy |
| Surface preparation limited | Complete crack preparation |
| No warranty | Lifetime guarantee |

## Our Approach: Honest Assessment First

When you contact Attack A Crack, we'll:

1. **Listen to your situation**: Sometimes we can tell from a description that DIY is appropriate.

2. **Review photos**: Text us pictures and we'll give you preliminary guidance.

3. **Provide honest assessment**: During consultations, we'll tell you if professional repair isn't needed.

4. **Explain DIY options**: When appropriate, we'll explain exactly how to handle it yourself.

We'd rather you trust us with the jobs that truly need professional work than resent us for selling you something you didn't need.

## Questions to Ask Yourself

Before calling a professional, consider:

- Is water actively entering through this crack?
- Is the crack growing (check over several weeks)?
- Is the crack wider than a credit card?
- Are there multiple cracks in a pattern?
- Is the wall bowing or leaning?
- Have DIY repairs already failed?

If you answered "yes" to any of these, professional assessment is warranted.

If all answers are "no," monitoring and minor DIY sealing may be sufficient.

## Still Not Sure?

That's what free consultations are for. We'll look at your situation and give you honest advice—even if that advice is "you don't need us."
