## A Foundation Partner for Home Inspectors

When you flag foundation issues in an inspection, your clients need a specialist who will give them honest information—not a sales pitch. We're the foundation repair partner you can recommend with confidence.

### Why Inspectors Refer to Us

**Honesty First**
Our reputation is built on telling the truth. When you send clients our way, they get an honest assessment:
- If cracks don't need repair, we say so
- If DIY is an option, we explain how
- If professional repair is needed, we explain why

This honesty protects your reputation. Clients remember when the contractor you recommended didn't try to oversell them.

**Technical Expertise**
We understand foundation science. When homeowners have questions about what you found, we can explain:
- Why the crack formed
- Whether it's structural or cosmetic
- What the repair involves
- What happens if they wait

**Professional Communication**
We treat your clients with the same professionalism you do:
- Prompt responses and on-time appointments
- Clear explanations without jargon
- Written quotes with no hidden fees
- Complete documentation for transaction files

### Common Inspection Findings We Address

**Vertical Shrinkage Cracks**
The most common finding. These hairline cracks often don't need repair, but we'll assess and give honest guidance.

**Diagonal Corner Cracks**
Can indicate settling or structural stress. We determine the cause and recommend appropriate action.

**Horizontal Cracks**
A more serious finding. We assess severity and provide options from monitoring to reinforcement.

**Water Infiltration Evidence**
Stains, efflorescence, or active leaks. We identify entry points and provide permanent solutions.

**Previous Repairs**
Failed DIY or previous professional repairs. We assess what went wrong and how to fix it properly.
