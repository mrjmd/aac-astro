faqs:
  - question: "How much does foundation repair cost in Framingham?"
    answer: "Foundation repair in Framingham typically costs between $450 and $2,400 for crack injection. Framingham's mix of post-war concrete foundations and older fieldstone construction means repair approaches vary by neighborhood. We offer free estimates for all properties."
  - question: "Why do Framingham basements leak?"
    answer: "Framingham's location along the Sudbury River watershed creates high water table conditions in many areas. Combined with the city's clay and glacial till soils—which don't drain well—hydrostatic pressure against foundations is common. Post-war homes are also reaching the age where original concrete begins to crack."
  - question: "Do you work in Framingham's historic areas?"
    answer: "Yes, we service all of Framingham including the historic Saxonville and Framingham Centre neighborhoods. These areas feature older fieldstone foundations that require specialized techniques to address water infiltration while preserving their historic character."

## Foundation Repair Services in Framingham, Massachusetts

As the heart of MetroWest, Framingham offers a diverse mix of historic villages, post-war subdivisions, and contemporary developments. The city's housing stock reflects this variety, with fieldstone-foundationed antiques in Saxonville standing alongside mid-century ranches in Nobscot and newer construction throughout. Attack A Crack provides comprehensive foundation repair services across all of Framingham's distinct neighborhoods, tailoring our approach to each property's specific needs.

Framingham's position along the Sudbury River watershed creates foundation challenges related to high water tables and poor soil drainage. Many neighborhoods experience seasonal water pressure against foundations, particularly during spring snowmelt and heavy rain events. The city's clay and glacial till soils compound these issues, holding moisture close to foundation walls. Our crack injection and waterproofing techniques are designed to address these specific conditions.

Whether you own a historic home in Framingham Centre, a mid-century Cape in Lokerville, or a contemporary Colonial in one of Framingham's newer developments, we deliver foundation repairs backed by our lifetime guarantee. Our team's familiarity with MetroWest soil conditions and construction practices ensures effective, lasting solutions. Contact us today for a free foundation consultation at your Framingham property.
