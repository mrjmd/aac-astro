faqs:
  - question: "How much does foundation repair cost in Cambridge?"
    answer: "Foundation repair in Cambridge typically costs between $600 and $3,500 for crack injection, depending on foundation type and condition. Cambridge's predominantly historic housing stock often requires specialized techniques that reflect in pricing. Free estimates available."
  - question: "Do you work on Victorian homes in Cambridge?"
    answer: "Absolutely. Cambridge's Victorian homes—from the mansions of Brattle Street to the worker housing of East Cambridge—are our specialty. We use techniques specifically designed for the fieldstone, brick, and rubble foundations common in these historic properties."
  - question: "Why are Cambridge basements so prone to water problems?"
    answer: "Cambridge's high water table, combined with its proximity to the Charles River and older housing stock, creates persistent moisture challenges. Many foundations predate modern waterproofing technology, and the city's clay soils don't drain well, increasing hydrostatic pressure."

## Foundation Repair Services in Cambridge, Massachusetts

Home to Harvard University and MIT, Cambridge combines world-class academic institutions with some of Greater Boston's most architecturally significant residential neighborhoods. The city's Victorian homes, worker cottages, and historic estates feature foundation systems that reflect over 150 years of building practices. Attack A Crack provides expert foundation repair throughout Cambridge, with particular expertise in the fieldstone and brick foundations prevalent in the city's older areas.

Cambridge's proximity to the Charles River and generally high water table create ongoing moisture challenges for homeowners. Many basements in Cambridgeport, East Cambridge, and even the elevated neighborhoods around Porter Square experience seasonal water infiltration through aging foundation walls. Our crack injection and waterproofing techniques address these issues without disturbing the historic fabric of Cambridge's cherished homes.

Whether you own a stately Victorian near Brattle Street, a classic triple-decker in Inman Square, or a converted carriage house in one of Cambridge's many historic districts, we deliver foundation repairs that last a lifetime. Our team respects both the architectural heritage and the investment you've made in your Cambridge property. Contact us for a free foundation assessment today.
