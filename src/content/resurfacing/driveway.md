  - question: "Can you resurface a driveway with large cracks?"

## Concrete Driveway Resurfacing in Massachusetts

Your driveway is one of the largest visible surfaces on your property. When it's covered in cracks, stains, and patches, it brings down your entire home's appearance. Driveway resurfacing restores beauty and function without the expense of complete replacement.

### Why Driveways Deteriorate

Massachusetts driveways face constant assault:
- **Heavy vehicle loads** stress concrete daily
- **Freeze-thaw cycles** expand cracks each winter
- **Road salt and de-icers** cause surface pitting
- **Oil and fluid leaks** leave permanent stains
- **UV exposure** fades and weakens the surface
- **Age** simply takes its toll

### The Resurfacing Solution

Our concrete overlay system creates a brand-new wearing surface over your existing driveway. The result looks like a freshly poured driveway—often better, thanks to decorative options original concrete doesn't offer.

**What Resurfacing Fixes:**
- Surface cracks and crazing
- Spalling and flaking
- Stains and discoloration
- Rough, worn texture
- Plain, dated appearance

### Design Options

Transform your driveway's appearance with:

**Colors**
- Classic grays (multiple shades)
- Earth tones and browns
- Custom color matching
- Two-tone borders and accents

**Patterns**
- Stamped stone looks
- Brick patterns
- Exposed aggregate appearance
- Custom geometric designs

**Finishes**
- Smooth troweled
- Broom textured
- Light sand texture
- Heavy slip-resistant

### Our Driveway Resurfacing Process

**1. Thorough Cleaning**
We pressure wash and degrease your driveway to remove all contaminants that could interfere with bonding.

**2. Crack Repair**
Every crack is addressed—filled, routed, or treated with crack isolation membrane as appropriate.

**3. Surface Profiling**
Grinding or etching creates the surface profile needed for permanent overlay adhesion.

**4. Overlay Application**
Multiple coats of polymer-modified overlay are applied, building to specified thickness (typically 1/8" to 1/4").

**5. Color and Pattern**
For decorative finishes, color is applied and patterns created while the material is workable.

**6. Protective Sealing**
High-quality sealer protects against stains, UV damage, and harsh Massachusetts weather.

### Timeline and Disruption

**Typical Project Duration:** 2-4 days depending on driveway size

**Timeline:**
- Day 1: Cleaning and prep
- Day 2: Repairs and base coat
- Day 3: Finish coats and decoration
- Day 4: Sealing and cleanup

**Cure Time:**
- Foot traffic: 24 hours
- Vehicle traffic: 3-5 days
- Full cure: 7-14 days

### When Replacement Is Better

We'll recommend replacement when:
- The concrete is severely heaved or settled
- Large areas have structural failure
- Previous overlays are failing
- Cost of repairs exceeds 60-70% of replacement cost

### Massachusetts Only

Driveway resurfacing is available throughout Massachusetts. For driveway cracks that are actually foundation-related, we serve both MA and CT for structural repair.
