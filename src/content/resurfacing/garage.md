faqs:
  - question: "What's the difference between resurfacing and epoxy coating?"
    answer: "Epoxy coatings are thin surface treatments that look great but may peel on damaged concrete. Our resurfacing system actually rebuilds the concrete surface before any coating, creating a permanent foundation for topcoats."
  - question: "Will the finish resist hot tire pickup?"
    answer: "Yes. We use polyaspartic topcoats that resist hot tire marks, a common problem with cheaper garage floor systems."
  - question: "Can you work around items in my garage?"
    answer: "We need the floor completely clear for resurfacing. Most clients temporarily relocate vehicles and items for 3-4 days during the project."

## Garage Floor Resurfacing in Massachusetts

Your garage floor endures chemical spills, road salt, hot tires, heavy impacts, and constant abuse. Over time, even quality concrete develops cracks, pits, and stains that make your garage look neglected. Resurfacing transforms your garage from eyesore to showpiece.

### The Problem with Garage Floors

Garage floors face unique challenges:
- **Chemical exposure** from oil, antifreeze, battery acid
- **Hot tire pickup** that peels cheap coatings
- **Impact damage** from dropped tools and equipment
- **Road salt** tracked in all winter
- **Moisture** from snow-covered vehicles
- **Abrasion** from foot traffic and moving items

### Beyond Basic Epoxy

Big-box store epoxy kits promise garage transformation, but they often fail because:
- Surface preparation is inadequate
- Concrete defects aren't addressed
- Products aren't formulated for garage conditions
- Application by untrained DIYers compromises results

Our professional resurfacing system addresses the concrete itself, creating a solid foundation for long-lasting finishes.

### Finish Options

**Solid Color**
Clean, professional look in a wide range of colors. Ideal for workshops and utility garages.

**Decorative Flake**
Vinyl color chips broadcast into the coating create depth and hide imperfections. The classic "garage floor" look.

**Metallic Epoxy**
Three-dimensional, flowing patterns that make your garage floor a work of art. Perfect for car enthusiasts.

**Quartz Broadcast**
Industrial-grade finish with exceptional durability. Excellent for high-use garages and workshops.
