## Pool Deck Resurfacing in Massachusetts

Your pool deck should be an inviting extension of your outdoor living space—not a cracked, stained eyesore that's too hot to walk on. Pool deck resurfacing transforms worn concrete into a beautiful, safe, and comfortable surface.

### Pool Deck Challenges

Pool decks face unique conditions:
- **Constant moisture** from splashing and wet feet
- **Chemical exposure** from chlorine and salt
- **UV damage** from direct sun
- **Temperature extremes** (hot surface, cold winters)
- **Slip hazards** when wet
- **High foot traffic** during pool season

Standard concrete often fails to meet these demands. Resurfacing with specialized materials solves these problems.

### Critical Safety Features

**Slip Resistance**
Wet concrete is dangerously slippery. Our pool deck surfaces incorporate slip-resistant textures and additives that maintain traction even when soaking wet. We meet or exceed safety standards for coefficient of friction.

**Cool-Touch Technology**
Dark concrete can reach 140°F+ in summer sun—impossible to walk on barefoot. Our cool-deck formulations reflect heat and stay comfortable even in full sun.

**Smooth but Safe**
Nobody wants rough concrete scratching their feet. Our textures strike the perfect balance—smooth enough for comfort, textured enough for safety.

### Design Options

**Colors**
- Sandstone and desert tones
- Cool grays and blues
- Terra cotta and earth tones
- Custom colors to match your outdoor decor

**Patterns**
- Natural stone looks
- Flagstone patterns
- Tile designs
- Textured solid colors

**Borders and Accents**
- Contrasting coping colors
- Decorative borders
- Inlaid patterns
- Custom logos or designs

### Our Pool Deck Process

**Assessment**
We evaluate your deck's condition, discuss your aesthetic preferences, and recommend the best approach.

**Preparation**
The deck is thoroughly cleaned, and all cracks and damage are repaired. Proper prep is crucial for pool decks that endure constant moisture.

**Application**
Multiple coats of our pool deck overlay system are applied. Special formulations ensure proper curing even in the humid pool environment.

**Texture and Color**
Slip-resistant texture is applied along with your chosen color. Decorative elements are added at this stage.

**Sealing**
Premium sealer protects against UV, chemicals, and stains while maintaining slip resistance.

### Timeline

- **Project duration:** 3-5 days depending on deck size
- **Pool use:** Resume 5-7 days after completion
- **Full cure:** 14 days

### Preparation Requirements

For best results, we recommend:
- Lowering pool water level slightly (we'll specify)
- Removing all furniture and accessories
- Ensuring adequate drainage away from pool
- Planning the project for dry weather
