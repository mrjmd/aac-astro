faqs:
  - question: "Can you resurface very damaged concrete stairs?"
    answer: "Yes, in most cases. Our overlay system can address significant damage including cracks, spalling, and surface deterioration. If the structural integrity is compromised, we'll let you know and recommend alternatives."
  - question: "How long does stairway resurfacing last?"
    answer: "With proper care, our resurfacing lasts 15-25 years. We use commercial-grade materials designed for high-traffic areas and New England's freeze-thaw cycles."
  - question: "Is the finish slippery when wet?"
    answer: "No. We always apply non-slip additives to stair surfaces. Safety is the top priority, especially on outdoor stairs exposed to rain and snow."

## Concrete Stairway Resurfacing in Massachusetts

Concrete stairs take a beating—constant foot traffic, de-icing salt, freeze-thaw cycles, and years of exposure to New England weather. When your stairs become cracked, spalled, or simply ugly, resurfacing offers a cost-effective alternative to full replacement.

### Why Resurface Instead of Replace?

**Cost Savings**
Resurfacing typically costs 30-50% less than demolishing and pouring new stairs. You get a like-new appearance without the expense and hassle of complete reconstruction.

**Faster Completion**
A full stair replacement can take a week or more. Resurfacing is typically completed in 1-2 days, with stairs ready for foot traffic within 24-48 hours.

**Design Options**
Resurfacing opens up design possibilities your original concrete didn't have:
- Multiple color options
- Decorative patterns and textures
- Stamped concrete looks
- Custom borders and accents

### Our Stairway Resurfacing Process

**1. Surface Preparation**
We thoroughly clean and profile the existing concrete. This step is critical—proper preparation ensures the new surface bonds permanently.

**2. Repair and Level**
Any cracks, chips, or uneven areas are repaired. We fill voids and level surfaces to create a smooth foundation.

**3. Apply Overlay System**
Our polymer-modified overlay is applied in layers, building up to the desired thickness. This material bonds molecularly to your existing concrete.

**4. Texture and Finish**
We apply your chosen finish—from simple broom textures to decorative stamped patterns. Non-slip additives are always included for stairs.

**5. Seal and Protect**
A penetrating sealer protects your new surface from stains, salt damage, and UV fading.

### Safety First: Non-Slip Surfaces

Stairs demand slip-resistant surfaces. We incorporate non-slip additives into every stair resurfacing project:
- Polymer additives for enhanced grip
- Textured finishes that maintain traction when wet
- Special attention to nosing (stair edges) where slips often occur

### Common Stairway Problems We Fix

- **Surface spalling** (flaking, peeling concrete)
- **Crack networks** and individual cracks
- **Exposed aggregate** from surface erosion
- **Salt damage** and pitting
- **Uneven or settling steps**
- **Worn, ugly appearance**

### What About Indoor Stairs?

While most of our stair resurfacing is exterior, we also resurface:
- Basement stairs
- Garage entry stairs
- Commercial interior stairs

The process is similar, with finish options appropriate for interior use.

Concrete resurfacing services are available exclusively in Massachusetts. For foundation repair services, we serve both Massachusetts and Connecticut.
