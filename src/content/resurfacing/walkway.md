## Concrete Walkway Resurfacing in Massachusetts

Your walkway is the first impression guests have of your home. When it's cracked, stained, or simply outdated, it detracts from your property's curb appeal. Walkway resurfacing gives you a fresh, beautiful surface without the cost and disruption of replacement.

### The Problem with Old Walkways

Massachusetts walkways endure brutal conditions:
- **Freeze-thaw cycles** that crack concrete from within
- **De-icing salts** that pit and erode surfaces
- **Tree roots** pushing up sections
- **Age and weathering** that dull once-attractive concrete
- **Oil and rust stains** that seem impossible to remove

Over time, these factors turn attractive walkways into eyesores—and potential trip hazards.

### Why Resurfacing Works

Our polymer-modified overlay creates a new wearing surface that:
- **Bonds permanently** to existing concrete
- **Bridges minor cracks** to prevent water infiltration
- **Resists freeze-thaw** better than original concrete
- **Provides design options** you didn't have before
- **Costs less** than replacement

### Design Possibilities

Unlike plain gray concrete, resurfacing offers unlimited design options:

**Colors**
Choose from earth tones, grays, browns, terra cotta, and more. We can even match your home's exterior trim.

**Patterns**
- Natural stone looks (flagstone, slate, fieldstone)
- Brick patterns
- Tile designs
- Custom borders and inlays
- Exposed aggregate looks

**Textures**
From smooth finishes to aggressive slip-resistant textures, we match the texture to your needs and preferences.

### Our Process

**Step 1: Evaluation**
We assess your existing walkway to ensure it's a good candidate for resurfacing. Most are—but we'll tell you honestly if replacement is better.

**Step 2: Preparation**
Cleaning, crack repair, and surface profiling prepare your walkway for the overlay.

**Step 3: Application**
Multiple coats of polymer-modified overlay are applied, each carefully troweled or sprayed to specification.

**Step 4: Pattern and Color**
For decorative finishes, we apply color, create patterns, and add texture at this stage.

**Step 5: Sealing**
Penetrating sealer protects your investment from stains, UV damage, and weather.

### When to Consider Replacement Instead

We believe in honest recommendations. Resurfacing isn't always the answer:
- Severely heaved or settled sections may need removal and re-pouring
- Walkways with major structural damage may not hold an overlay
- If more than 50% of the surface is severely damaged, replacement may be more cost-effective

We'll give you an honest assessment during your free consultation.
