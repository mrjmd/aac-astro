faqs:
  - question: "Why do pipes leak where they enter the foundation?"
    answer: "When pipes were installed through your foundation, small gaps were left or filled with inadequate materials. Over time, these gaps expand due to settling and freeze-thaw cycles."
  - question: "Can you seal active leaks around pipes?"
    answer: "Yes. Our injection process works even with active water infiltration. The urethane reacts with water to expand and seal, making it perfect for wet conditions."
  - question: "Will the repair affect my plumbing or electrical?"
    answer: "No. Our injection fills only the gap between the pipe and foundation. It doesn't enter your pipes or affect their function in any way."
  - question: "How do you access pipes that are behind walls?"
    answer: "Many pipe penetrations are accessible from the interior. For those behind finished walls, we can work through small access points with minimal disruption."

## Utility Line Penetration Sealing

Every pipe, conduit, and line that enters your foundation is a potential leak point. Sewer lines, well pipes, electrical conduits, and gas lines all create penetrations that can allow water infiltration. We seal these gaps permanently without excavation.

### Common Utility Penetration Problems

**Sewer Lines**
Main sewer lines typically exit through the foundation wall or floor slab. The gap between pipe and concrete is a frequent source of basement water.

**Well Lines**
If your home uses well water, the supply line enters through the foundation. This penetration is especially prone to leaking due to ground movement around the well.

**Electrical Conduits**
Electrical service enters most homes through the foundation. The conduit-to-concrete joint often fails over time.

**Other Penetrations**
- Gas lines
- Water service lines
- Cable/internet conduits
- Radon mitigation pipes
- Oil fill pipes

### Why These Penetrations Leak

When your home was built, penetrations were sealed with:
- **Hydraulic cement**: Shrinks as it cures, creating gaps
- **Caulk or sealant**: Degrades within years
- **Oakum and lead**: Old method that eventually fails
- **Nothing at all**: Some builders left gaps unsealed

Over time, settling and ground movement widen these gaps. Water finds the path of least resistance—right through your foundation.

### Our Injection Sealing Process

**1. Locate All Penetrations**
We identify every pipe, conduit, and line entering your foundation. Some may be hidden behind finished walls or covered by previous repairs.

**2. Prepare for Injection**
We install injection ports around each penetration and prepare the surface.

**3. Inject Flexible Urethane**
Our specialized urethane is injected around the penetration. It flows into every void, expands to fill gaps, and bonds to both the pipe and concrete.

**4. Verify Complete Seal**
We confirm the seal is complete and remove any excess material. The repair is waterproof immediately.

### Benefits of Our Approach

**No Excavation**
Traditional repairs require digging around your foundation exterior. Our injection works from inside your basement.

**Works on All Pipe Types**
- PVC
- Cast iron
- Copper
- Galvanized steel
- Corrugated conduit
- Rigid electrical conduit

**Permanent Flexibility**
Our urethane seal remains flexible, accommodating movement between pipe and foundation without cracking.

### Signs You Need Penetration Sealing

- Water stains around pipes entering basement
- Active dripping during rain
- Efflorescence (white mineral deposits) near penetrations
- Previous repairs that have failed
- Damp odors near utility entry points

### The Attack A Crack Difference

- **Complete penetration audit**—we find leaks you didn't know about
- **Non-invasive repair**—no digging, no mess
- **Same-day completion** for most jobs
- **Lifetime guarantee** on all sealing work
