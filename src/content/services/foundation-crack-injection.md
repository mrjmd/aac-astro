faqs:
  - question: "What is foundation crack injection?"
    answer: "Crack injection is the process of filling a foundation crack with specialized resin under pressure. The material fills the entire crack depth, from the interior surface to the exterior soil."
  - question: "How long does injected material last?"
    answer: "Our injection materials are designed to last the lifetime of your home. That's why we back every repair with a lifetime guarantee."
  - question: "Can you inject cracks in any weather?"
    answer: "Yes. Our injection process works in any season and any weather condition. We can even inject into actively leaking cracks."
  - question: "What's the difference between urethane and epoxy injection?"
    answer: "Urethane remains flexible and expands to fill voids—ideal for waterproofing. Epoxy creates a structural bond stronger than concrete—ideal for structural repairs."

## Foundation Crack Injection: The Science of Permanent Repair

Foundation crack injection is the gold standard for repairing poured concrete foundation cracks. Unlike surface sealers or patches, injection fills the entire crack from interior surface to exterior soil, creating a complete seal that lasts.

### How Crack Injection Works

**The Problem**
Foundation cracks aren't surface issues—they extend through the entire wall thickness (typically 8-10 inches). Surface repairs only address what you can see, leaving the rest of the crack open to water infiltration.

**The Solution**
Crack injection fills the complete crack void. Under controlled pressure, specialized resin is forced through the crack, filling it completely. The result is a solid repair that's as strong as—or stronger than—the original concrete.

### Our Injection Process

**Step 1: Crack Assessment**
We evaluate each crack to determine:
- Cause of cracking
- Whether it's active (still moving) or dormant
- Structural vs. non-structural nature
- Appropriate injection material

**Step 2: Surface Preparation**
Injection ports are installed along the crack at intervals. The surface is then sealed with a fast-setting epoxy paste to contain the injection material.

**Step 3: Low-Pressure Injection**
Starting from the lowest port, we inject resin under controlled pressure. As each port fills, we move to the next, ensuring complete penetration.

**Step 4: Cure and Completion**
The injection material cures within hours. We remove ports and surface seal, leaving a clean finished appearance.

### Injection Material Options

**Flexible Polyurethane**
- Expands up to 20x original volume
- Remains flexible after curing
- Reacts with water to accelerate cure
- Best for: Waterproofing, active cracks, moving cracks

**Structural Epoxy**
- Creates bond stronger than concrete
- Rigid when cured
- Restores structural integrity
- Best for: Structural cracks, load-bearing walls

**Hybrid Approach**
Some cracks benefit from both materials—epoxy for structural strength at critical points, urethane for flexibility and waterproofing throughout.

### Why Injection Beats Other Methods

| Method | Fills Complete Crack | Flexible | Structural | Permanent |
|--------|---------------------|----------|------------|-----------|
| Injection | Yes | Available | Available | Yes |
| Surface Seal | No | Varies | No | No |
| Hydraulic Cement | No | No | No | No |
| Caulk | No | Yes | No | No |

### Types of Cracks We Inject

- Vertical shrinkage cracks
- Diagonal settlement cracks
- Stair-step cracks in block walls
- Cracks around windows and doors
- Floor-to-wall joint cracks
- Cracks at cold joints

### When Injection Isn't the Answer

We believe in honest assessment. Some situations require different approaches:
- **Severely deteriorated concrete**: May need section replacement
- **Bowing walls**: Require stabilization before crack repair
- **Active structural movement**: Must address cause first
- **Block wall cores**: May need interior drainage instead

We'll always recommend the right solution—even if it means referring you elsewhere.

### The Attack A Crack Injection Guarantee

- **Lifetime warranty** on all injection repairs
- **Complete crack filling**—we don't stop until it's done
- **Clean, professional work**—your basement stays clean
- **Expert assessment**—honest recommendations every time
