faqs:
  - question: "What are carbon fiber stitches?"
    answer: "Carbon fiber stitches are high-strength reinforcement strips embedded across foundation cracks. They're 10x stronger than steel by weight and prevent further crack movement."
  - question: "When are carbon fiber stitches needed?"
    answer: "Carbon fiber is used when cracks show signs of structural movement or when you want extra reinforcement beyond injection alone. They're common for diagonal cracks and corner damage."
  - question: "Are carbon fiber repairs visible?"
    answer: "The stitches are low-profile and can be painted over. Most homeowners find them unobtrusive, and they're hidden entirely if walls are later finished."
  - question: "How long do carbon fiber repairs last?"
    answer: "Carbon fiber doesn't corrode, stretch, or degrade. Your repair will last the lifetime of your home, backed by our guarantee."

## Carbon Fiber Foundation Repair: Maximum Strength, Minimal Intrusion

When foundation cracks indicate structural stress, carbon fiber stitches provide the reinforcement needed to stop movement and stabilize your foundation. This advanced repair method adds incredible strength without the cost and disruption of traditional structural repairs.

### What Are Carbon Fiber Stitches?

Carbon fiber stitches are reinforcement strips made from high-strength carbon fiber fabric embedded in structural epoxy. When installed across foundation cracks, they:

- **Prevent further crack expansion**
- **Distribute stress across a wider area**
- **Add tensile strength to the concrete**
- **Create permanent structural reinforcement**

### The Science Behind Carbon Fiber

Carbon fiber is an engineered material with remarkable properties:

- **10x stronger than steel** (by weight)
- **Completely corrosion-resistant**
- **Zero elongation under load**
- **Bonds permanently to concrete**
- **Thin profile** (less than 1/8" when installed)

These properties make carbon fiber ideal for foundation repair. Unlike steel reinforcement that can rust and expand (causing more damage), carbon fiber remains stable indefinitely.

### When Carbon Fiber Is Needed

**Structural Crack Patterns**
- Diagonal cracks from corners of windows/doors
- Stair-step cracks in block foundations
- Horizontal cracks with wall displacement
- Cracks wider than 1/4 inch
- Cracks showing differential movement

**High-Stress Areas**
- Foundation corners
- Areas near large trees
- Walls showing bowing
- Previously repaired cracks that re-opened

**Preventive Reinforcement**
- Added protection for injection repairs
- Reinforcing older foundations
- Preparation for increased loads (additions, etc.)

### Our Carbon Fiber Installation Process

**Step 1: Surface Preparation**
We grind a shallow channel across the crack where the stitch will be installed. The concrete surface is cleaned and profiled for optimal bonding.

**Step 2: Crack Injection**
Before installing stitches, we inject the crack to seal and fill it completely. This addresses water infiltration and provides a stable base.

**Step 3: Stitch Installation**
Carbon fiber fabric is saturated with structural epoxy and embedded into the prepared channel. The material bonds permanently to the concrete.

**Step 4: Finishing**
Once cured, the repair can be smoothed and painted to blend with surrounding walls. The low profile makes it nearly invisible.

### Carbon Fiber vs. Traditional Methods

**Steel Straps**
- Prone to corrosion over time
- Require more invasive installation
- Higher profile on wall surface
- Can cause additional cracking

**Concrete Replacement**
- Extremely expensive
- Major disruption to home
- Creates new cold joints
- Long project timeline

**Carbon Fiber Stitches**
- Never corrodes or degrades
- Quick, clean installation
- Low profile appearance
- Same-day completion

### Applications Beyond Cracks

Carbon fiber reinforcement can also be used for:
- **Wall stabilization**: Reinforcing bowing walls
- **Beam wrapping**: Strengthening wooden beams
- **Slab reinforcement**: Adding strength to concrete floors
- **Preventive strengthening**: Reinforcing before problems develop

### The Attack A Crack Carbon Fiber Advantage

- **Expert assessment**—we'll tell you if you really need carbon fiber
- **Proper installation**—surface prep is critical for permanent bonding
- **Combined approach**—injection + carbon fiber for complete repair
- **Lifetime guarantee**—we stand behind every installation
