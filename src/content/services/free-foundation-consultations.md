## Free Foundation Consultations: Honest Answers, No Pressure

At Attack A Crack, we believe you deserve to understand what's happening with your foundation before you spend a dime. That's why every consultation is completely free, and we'll never pressure you into services you don't need.

### What Makes Our Consultations Different

**No Salespeople**
When you call Attack A Crack, you're talking to the actual experts who do the work. We don't employ commission-based sales staff whose job is to close deals. You get honest information from people who care about doing the right thing.

**We'll Tell You the Truth**
Some cracks don't need professional repair. If your issue is cosmetic or something you can handle yourself, we'll tell you—and we'll explain exactly how to do it. Our reputation is built on honesty, not maximizing sales.

**Education, Not Fear**
The foundation repair industry has a reputation for scare tactics. We take the opposite approach: we educate you about what we're seeing, what it means, and what your real options are. Knowledge removes fear.

### What Happens During a Consultation

**1. Initial Conversation**
We start by listening. Tell us what you've noticed, what concerns you have, and any history you know about the issue. Your observations are valuable information.

**2. Thorough Assessment**
We examine your foundation carefully, looking at:
- Crack patterns and characteristics
- Signs of water infiltration
- Evidence of structural movement
- Related issues you may not have noticed
- Previous repairs and their condition

**3. Clear Explanation**
We explain exactly what we found in plain language:
- What's causing the problem
- How serious it is (or isn't)
- What could happen if left unaddressed
- What your repair options are

**4. Honest Recommendations**
Based on our assessment, we'll recommend a course of action. This might be:
- **"Do nothing"**—some issues are purely cosmetic
- **"Monitor it"**—with specific guidance on what to watch for
- **"DIY repair"**—with instructions on how to do it yourself
- **"Professional repair"**—with a detailed explanation of what's involved

**5. Transparent Quote**
If professional repair is warranted, we provide a clear, itemized quote with no hidden fees. We explain exactly what we'll do and why it costs what it does.

### Things We'll Always Tell You

- If a crack is cosmetic and doesn't need repair
- If you can fix something yourself (and how to do it)
- If another company might serve you better for a specific issue
- The honest timeline for how urgent repairs are
- When monitoring is appropriate vs. immediate action

### Things We'll Never Do

- Use scare tactics to pressure you into buying
- Recommend unnecessary repairs to increase the bill
- Rush you into a decision
- Charge for the consultation or quote
- Send salespeople instead of technicians

### Common Consultation Outcomes

**"You're All Set"**
Some homeowners expect bad news and learn their cracks are minor settling cracks that need no intervention.

**"Here's How to DIY"**
For small, simple issues, we'll walk you through exactly how to handle it yourself. We'd rather you know the truth than pay for something you don't need.

**"Let's Watch This"**
Sometimes the best approach is monitoring. We'll tell you exactly what to look for and when to call us back.

**"This Needs Repair"**
When professional repair is genuinely needed, we explain why and provide a clear path forward.
