faqs:
  - question: "Why does my bulkhead leak?"
    answer: "Bulkheads leak when the seal between the precast unit and your foundation fails. This happens due to settling, deteriorated gaskets, or improper original installation."
  - question: "Can you repair any type of bulkhead?"
    answer: "Yes. We repair all types of bulkhead doors including precast concrete, steel, and combination units. Our injection method works on any bulkhead-to-foundation connection."
  - question: "How long does bulkhead repair take?"
    answer: "Most bulkhead repairs are completed in 2-3 hours. The seal begins working immediately, though we recommend waiting 24 hours before heavy rain exposure."
  - question: "Is bulkhead replacement necessary?"
    answer: "Usually not. Most leaking bulkheads don't need replacement—they need proper sealing. Our injection repair costs a fraction of replacement and lasts just as long."

## Bulkhead Door Leak Repair: A Permanent Solution

A leaking bulkhead door turns every rainstorm into a basement flooding event. Water pools on your bulkhead stairs, seeps through the foundation joint, and floods your basement. We fix this problem permanently with our specialized injection process.

### Why Bulkheads Leak

The connection between your precast bulkhead unit and poured foundation is the weak point. This joint fails because:

- **Original gaskets deteriorate**: Rubber and foam gaskets break down over time
- **Settling creates gaps**: As your home settles, the bulkhead can shift
- **Water pressure**: Hydrostatic pressure forces water through tiny gaps
- **Freeze-thaw damage**: Ice expansion widens existing gaps
- **Poor original installation**: Many bulkheads were installed without adequate sealing

### Our Bulkhead Repair Process

**Step 1: Remove Failed Material**
We remove any deteriorated gasket material and clean the joint thoroughly. This ensures our injection bonds directly to the concrete.

**Step 2: Prepare the Joint**
We install injection ports at strategic points along the bulkhead-foundation connection.

**Step 3: Inject Flexible Urethane**
Our specialized urethane foam is injected into the joint. It expands to fill every void and creates a waterproof seal that remains flexible as your home moves.

**Step 4: Seal and Finish**
We seal the injection points and clean up completely. Your bulkhead is protected immediately.

### Why Injection Beats Other Methods

**Traditional Caulking**
- Surface seal only
- Cracks and separates within 1-2 years
- Doesn't address subsurface voids

**Tar/Asphalt Products**
- Messy and temporary
- Becomes brittle in cold weather
- Requires frequent reapplication

**Our Injection Method**
- Fills the entire joint from inside out
- Remains flexible for decades
- One-time permanent repair
- Backed by lifetime guarantee

### Signs Your Bulkhead Needs Repair

- Water on bulkhead stairs during rain
- Puddles forming at the bottom of stairs
- Water stains on basement walls near bulkhead
- Visible gaps between bulkhead and foundation
- Musty odors coming from bulkhead area
- Previous repairs that have failed

### The Attack A Crack Bulkhead Advantage

- **Permanent repair**, not a temporary patch
- **Lifetime guarantee** on all bulkhead sealing
- **No messy excavation** required
- **Same-day service** available
- **Works in any weather**—we can even seal during active leaks
