## Foundation Wall Crack Repair That Lasts a Lifetime

Cracks in your foundation walls aren't just cosmetic issues—they're pathways for water infiltration that can lead to structural damage, mold growth, and decreased home value. At Attack A Crack, we specialize in permanent wall crack repair using proven injection techniques.

### Why Foundation Walls Crack

Foundation cracks develop for several reasons:

- **Settling and shifting**: As your home settles over time, stress can cause cracks to form
- **Hydrostatic pressure**: Water pressure from saturated soil pushes against foundation walls
- **Freeze-thaw cycles**: New England's harsh winters cause concrete to expand and contract
- **Tree roots**: Large trees near foundations can create pressure as roots grow
- **Poor construction**: Inadequate curing or improper concrete mix can lead to early cracking

### Our Wall Crack Repair Process

**1. Assessment**
We start with a thorough evaluation of your crack. Not all cracks are created equal—we identify whether you're dealing with a shrinkage crack, structural crack, or water-infiltration issue.

**2. Preparation**
We install injection ports along the length of the crack and seal the surface to contain the injection material.

**3. Injection**
Using specialized equipment, we inject either flexible urethane resin or structural epoxy deep into the crack. The material fills the entire void, from the inside surface to the outer soil.

**4. Curing and Cleanup**
The injection material cures within hours. We remove the ports, clean up our work area, and leave your basement better than we found it.

### Urethane vs. Epoxy: Choosing the Right Solution

**Flexible Urethane**
- Best for: Active cracks that may continue to move
- Benefits: Expands to fill voids, remains flexible, waterproof
- Ideal for: Most residential foundation cracks

**Structural Epoxy**
- Best for: Cracks requiring structural bonding
- Benefits: Creates bond stronger than original concrete
- Ideal for: Load-bearing cracks, structural repairs

### When to Repair Foundation Cracks

Don't wait for water to pour in. Signs you need wall crack repair:
